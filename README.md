## Local Dev
To set up local dev environment you need to have the docker runtime active
in the root run 
 - `docker build -t devcontainer .`
 - `docker -d -p {targetPort:port} -it devcontainer bash`

Check with Docker Desktop to see if container is running. \
Open up VsCode and connect to running container
